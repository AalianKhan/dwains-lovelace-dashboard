# How to choose and use an icon

Dwains Theme has support for Font Awesome and Material Design icons. For Font Awesome only the free icons are included. 

### Font awesome
[Here you can search your FA icons](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery&m=free). If you click on a icon you see the name of the icon in the top and below that you see Solid Style, Regular Style or Light style. You then need to use the icon like this:

* A Solid style icon: `fas:icon-name`
* A Regular style icon: `far:icon-name`
* A Light style icon: `fal:icon-name` (Only works if you got Pro icons)

### Material design icons
[Here you can search for MD icons](https://materialdesignicons.com/). When you mouseover on a icon you see the name of the icon. You can then use the icon like: `mdi:icon-name`
