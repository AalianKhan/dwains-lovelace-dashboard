# Addons

With Dwains Theme Addons you can extend the theme functionality with own addons without changing any of the theme cores code. This way you can always update to the latest version without problems but still add own views/cards.

There are a few type off addons possible right now. 

## Addons
* [Room addons](room.md)
* [More page addons](more_page.md)
* [Dynamic page addons](dynamic_page.md)
